  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I wasn’t born into this life. It started simple enough — just a kid with big dreams and no idea how the world worked. <br>
  But you know what they say: when opportunity knocks, you don’t ask questions. You just open the door.</p>

<p>It started small—just a favor for a friend. They needed someone who could code a quick fix, no questions asked. 
  I didn’t think much of it. I did the job, handed it off, and thought I was out. But the thrill stuck with me</p>

<p>Pretty soon, I wasn’t just fixing things—I was building them. Every new project, every late night, it all felt like I was moving up. 
  And just like that, I wasn’t some outsider anymore. I was in. People started coming to me for answers.</p>

<p>Then came the big one—the project that changed everything. Everyone said it couldn’t be done. But I wasn’t about to back down. 
  I put everything I had into it. And when the dust settled, I had something I could be proud of.</p>

<p>Now? Now I run my own operation. I’ve built something I can stand behind, something real. 
  But the game doesn’t stop—it just keeps moving. And me? I’m right here, ready for whatever comes next.</p>

<p>They say every journey starts with a single step. Mine just happened to step into the deep end—and I’ve been swimming ever since.</p>
